# Basic-GPT-3-Chatbot
A simple GPT-3 chatbot NOT CHATGPT

## Why?
I was bored. I do plan on updating this

## Prerequisites
openai AND tkinter PIP package

an openai API_KEY

## Uses
You can bind it to a hotkey for an easy Virtual Assistant. It knows a lot and is relatively quick. It uses OpenAIs davinci-003. 

## Limitations
Current times and events are a no-go, no special formatting unlike ChatGPT. Unfortunately OpenAI doesn't allow API calls to ChatGPT.

## Future
I want to add different personalities and language models, along with a cleaner UI.
